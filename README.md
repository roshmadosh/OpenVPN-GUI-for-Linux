# GUI for Linux OpenVPN Client  

OpenVPN v3 doesn't support "--auth-user-pass" but if it did I would have included form-based authentication. Instead the auth details have to be written in a configuration file labeled `<profile-name>.autoload` along with the profile's `.conf` or `.ovpn` file (see [openvpn-3-linux-and-auth-user-pass](https://openvpn.net/blog/openvpn-3-linux-and-auth-user-pass/)).  

Gonna try to find a way to select from multiple configs, but worst case scenario the GUI will function just like the Windows client that just has a button to let you connect.
